\section{About Me}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}
& \footnotesize{I'm just a curious person that really loves to learn new things. I like to ask myself how everything work and how things could be improved, because I think nothing is in a final state, everything can be evolved in a new wonderful thing with new features.
\newline
\newline
I love the way is possible to mix science and technology to make things faster and better, that's why I would love to find a way to contribute from my knowledge to this area.
\newline
\newline
I'm a person that loves what he does, I strongly agree with the idea that the only way to be happy is doing what you love, doesn't matter how much money you could earn doing another thing, how comfortable you could be right now, or simply how hard it could be get it, you have to try it and keep looking forward to it.
\newline
\newline
I also love work in a team, because, I think each person can learn amazing things from each other, and I'm not talking just in a professional way, everybody has a lot to teach to you if you are open enough to see it and receive it.
\newline
\newline
Finally I love to teach, I think seeing people interested by something trying to improve his knowledge and reaching his goals is wonderful, that's why I love it, specially when a person have a truly intention to learn. I strongly agree with the idea that knowledge is not something you can restrict and share it is the best way to make society better.}

\textsc{2015 - Present} & Part Mobile Development Area at Ceiba Software.\\
& \footnotesize{
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EMI - Health Software:} My main work on that was to fix features in both Mobile and Back-End, in order to improve response time, add customer value, reduce mobile battery consumption, improve data storage, centralize data by consuming and creating web services.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mobile Technology:} Titanium - Appcelerator, Android version.
\item \textbf{Back-End:} Java.
\item \textbf{Front-End:} JSP.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Intern Projects:} Mainly I created components that make easier to mix technologies or work with some specific ones, for example make the development in Xamarin Studio easier. I also worked creating a generic component in Android that could be used for each application and help to make the development faster.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mobile Technologies:} Android, Xamarin.
\item \textbf{WebServices:} SprintBoot.
\item \textbf{Desktop:} Shell Scripting.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Rapicredit:} Currently I'm working with Rapicredit, an application that works with credits, I've been working focused in Back-End, trying to optimize some critical features in the application like response time, users interactions, cleaning DB, using MySQL DB and not H2 DB for WSO2, etc. For this task I've been working with Back-End components like LDAP,  WSO2 and using some programming languages like C++ and Java to make that task easier and automatic.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mobile technology:} Android.
\item \textbf{Back-End} Java, Sprint, LDAP, WSO2, Nginx.
\end{itemize}

\textsc{2013 - 2014} & Part Mobile Development Team of Duing Application\\
& \footnotesize{Duing is a social application for mobile devices.
My team developed the Android native application for Duing, I focused mainly in consume data from Web Services and management of mobile databases. I had to be really careful, because that application save a lot of user data so aspects like memory, energy and time were really important, all of this based in the UX principles, I also worked with graphic interface.}\\

The software will try to execute the connected jobs and it will show if the task could be completed along with its result, doing the same task as if you run the command \texttt{echo hello world | wc \&} in the shell.
\item \textbf{Nower}: Application to recommend special offers based in the user location, the final user(Buyer) application was created in Android, Client (Stores) was created with HTML5 and Javascript with AngularJs and the BackEnd was created with Ruby on Rails.
\item \textbf{Numerical}: An Android application in order to interpret numerical functions and evaluate them with different numerical methods learned in the subject Numerical Methods.
\item \textbf{Graphics}: Java desktop application with different graphics methods to represent objects and change his properties(scale, rotate, etc).
\item \textbf{CoffeeStart}: CoffeeShop Cashier Application developed in Assembler.
\item \textbf{CloudYa}: A Web Image Hosting Application developed in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP.
