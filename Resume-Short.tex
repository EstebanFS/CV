\section{About Me}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}
& \footnotesize{I'm just a curious person that really loves to learn new things. I like to ask myself how everything work and how things could be improved, because I think nothing is in a final state, everything can be evolved in a new wonderful thing with new features.
\newline
\newline
I love the way is possible to mix science and technology to make things faster and better, that's why I would love to find a way to contribute from my knowledge to this area.
\newline
\newline
I'm a person that loves what he does, I strongly agree with the idea that the only way to be happy is doing what you love, doesn't matter how much money you could earn doing another thing, how comfortable you could be right now, or simply how hard it could be get it, you have to try it and keep looking forward to it.
\newline
\newline
I also love work in a team, because, I think each person can learn amazing things from each other, and I'm not talking just in a professional way, everybody has a lot to teach to you if you are open enough to see it and receive it.
\newline
\newline
Finally I love to teach, I think seeing people interested by something trying to improve his knowledge and reaching his goals is wonderful, that's why I love it, specially when a person have a truly intention to learn. I strongly agree with the idea that knowledge is not something you can restrict and share it is the best way to make society better.}

\item \textbf{Algorithms on Graphs}\\
\textbf{Chosen Programming Language:} C++
\iffalse
\textbf{Summary:} Explanation about graphs and their properties, starting from how is the best way to represent them taking into account the number of nodes and edges, going through how to traverse a graph, find a shortest path and minimum spanning tree. Time and space complexity are the main factor of the described algorithms.
\fi
\item \textbf{Algorithms on Strings}\\
\textbf{Chosen Programming Language:} C++
\iffalse
\textbf{Summary:} This course is oriented to Science and how to use string algorithms to solve many genetic problems. In this course one does see topics like Suffix Tree, Suffix Array, KMP and Burrows-Wheeler Transformation. Each module of the course give the complexity and how the algorithms were evolving from some previous one in order to improve time and memory.
